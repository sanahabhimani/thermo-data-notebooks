# Thermometry Data + Analysis for SO Circa ~ 2019-2022
This repository contains Yale cooldown data and thermometry data from various Simons Observatory (SO) institutions, accompanied by corresponding Python notebooks. The datasets include SO Rox data from Yale and other SO institutions, Yale Lakeshore Calibrator data, Yale Bluefors Mixing Chamber (MXC) data, and standard calibrator data from SO institutions, as well as their MXC data. Please note that this work was developed early in graduate school and is by no means a well-organized system of notebooks, but rather reflects a stream-of-consciousness approach, with less organization than later projects.
